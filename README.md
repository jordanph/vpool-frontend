# VePool

VePool is a decentralised staking service that allows user's to enter a pool by depositing VET, accruing their THOR interest in VET, and being able to withdraw at any time. The main benefits of such a system are:

- Automatic conversion of THOR to VET at current market price
- Bonus THOR generation if pool reaches the node thresholds

**But most importantly, you are always in control of your assets.**

Having deployed VePool on the Vechain Blockchain, the smarts of the contract live within the public domain. The unique design of the contract means that only the user that deposited into the contract can withdraw their stake.
